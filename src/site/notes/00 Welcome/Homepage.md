# 👋 Welcome to MedDude

I'm **MedDude**, a university student who genuinely enjoyed cracking past papers and explaining things that once felt impossible. Back when I was doing my A Levels, I always wished something like this existed , a space that made studying feel a little less lonely, and a lot more clear.

This site is my version of that.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This is a **[[500 Published/digital garden\|digital garden]]** , a growing library of curated notes, exam strategies, past paper walkthroughs, and explanations. All made for:

- 📘 **IGCSE**
- 📕 **GCSE**
- 📗 **A Level**
- 📙 **International A Level (IAL)**

Everything here is built on the **Edexcel syllabus**, including [[500 Published/What are Legacy qualifications\|legacy qualifications]]. No sign-ups. No nonsense. Just organized, evolving content, designed the way I wish I had it when I was preparing for exams.

## 📦 What You’ll Find Here

- **Sorted Past Papers**  
  Clean, filterable, no digging required.

- **Focused Notes**  
  Based on real understanding — not just content dumps.

- **Clickable Syllabi**  
  Topic-by-topic breakdowns with links to exactly what you need.

- **Cross-Linked Topics**  
  See how ideas connect across subjects (like mechanics in Maths & Physics).

- **Study as a Journey**  
  This garden grows as I do. You’ll see notes evolve, ideas expand, and new resources drop in.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Built for Students, by a Student

I got 3A*'s in Edexcel IAL Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. That didn’t come from pure talent, it came from trial, error, late nights, and figuring out what actually works.

I’m building a space where students can not only **study smarter**, but also **support each other**. So if you’re preparing for exams, or just want a better way to learn, I hope this helps.
