# 🌱 What is a Digital Garden?

Welcome to **Meddude's Digital Garden**: a place where ideas grow in public.

This isn't your typical polished blog or static website. Instead, it’s a living collection of notes, thoughts, and resources which all evolving over time.

> A digital garden is about **learning in public**. The goal isn’t perfection, the goal is progress. As I explore new ideas, solve problems, or break down complex topics, I’ll share them here  in it's most basic, real, and useful form.

Whether you're a student, a curious learner, or someone revisiting a tricky concept for the 5th time (we've all been there 😅), this space is for you.

## 💡 Why a Digital Garden for Meddude?

Meddude started as a way to help students through YouTube: breaking down exam techniques, explaining concepts simply, and sharing tools that actually help.

But YouTube alone isn’t enough for all the depth I want to share.

That’s where this digital garden comes in.

Here, you’ll find:
- 🌍 Notes on IGCSE, GCSE, A-Level, and IAL subjects (especially Edexcel)
- 📚 Interconnected explanations of core topics  for example:  like how **vectors** link across Maths and Physics
- 📝 Study strategies and revision techniques
- 🎯 Real-time ideas I'm exploring, testing, or refining
- 🧠 A knowledge base you can come back to, click around in, and use however you like

## 🌿 Work in Progress, Always Growing

These notes aren’t final. They’ll be updated, linked, cleaned up, and expanded — just like real understanding grows over time.

Think of this site like a **garden**: some plants are small and new, some are mature, and others are still just seeds.

Thanks for being here.
